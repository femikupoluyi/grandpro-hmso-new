# Step 4 Complete: Digital Sourcing & Partner Onboarding Backend Module

## Implementation Overview
Successfully developed the complete backend infrastructure for the Digital Sourcing & Partner Onboarding module with full Nigerian context integration.

## Database Schema Extensions (8 New Tables)
1. **OnboardingApplication** - Hospital applications with Nigerian-specific fields
2. **OnboardingDocument** - Document management with SHA-256 checksums
3. **EvaluationScore** - Multi-criteria weighted scoring system
4. **OnboardingContract** - Digital contract management
5. **ContractTemplate** - Reusable contract templates
6. **OnboardingProgress** - 9-stage progress tracking
7. **OnboardingChecklist** - Task management system
8. **EvaluationCriteria** - Configurable evaluation parameters

## API Endpoints Created (30+)
### Public Routes
- POST /api/onboarding/applications/submit
- GET /api/onboarding/applications/status/:applicationNumber
- POST /api/onboarding/applications/:id/documents

### Protected Routes (Admin/Staff)
- Application management (CRUD operations)
- Evaluation submission and auto-scoring
- Contract generation and digital signatures
- Progress tracking and stage updates
- Document verification
- Template management
- Analytics and reporting

## Core Services Implemented
1. **OnboardingService** - Core business logic
2. **ContractService** - Contract generation with PDF creation
3. **DocumentService** - Secure file handling
4. **EmailService** - Notification system
5. **Evaluation Utilities** - Weighted scoring algorithms
6. **Generators** - Unique ID generation (APP-YYYY-MM-XXXXXX format)

## Nigerian Context Features
-  All 36 states + FCT validation
-  Nigerian phone number validation (+234 format)
- ✅ NIN (National Identification Number) support
- ✅ Priority scoring for underserved states (Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, etc.)
-  NGN currency formatting throughout
- ✅ Africa/Lagos timezone
-  Local Government Area (LGA) tracking

## Automated Evaluation System
### 8-Criteria Weighted Scoring:
- Facility (15%) - Based on bed capacity and amenities
- Staffing (15%) - Staff count and ratios
- Equipment (15%) - Available services
- Compliance (20%) - Document verification
- Financial (10%) - Revenue potential
- Location (10%) - Priority for underserved areas
- Services (10%) - Service variety
- Reputation (5%) - Reference checks

## Security Features
- JWT authentication middleware
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- File upload validation (10MB max)
- Document integrity verification
- Request sanitization with Joi validators
