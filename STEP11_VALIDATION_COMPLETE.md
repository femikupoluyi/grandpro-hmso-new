Validate that the command centre aggregates data from multiple hospital instances and that alerts fire under simulated anomaly conditions.

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Multi-Hospital Data Aggregation ✅

**Test Configuration:**
- 3 Hospital Instances Simulated

**Aggregation Results:**
```
Total Hospitals: 3
Total Patients Tracked: 5,944
Combined Revenue: ₦10,974,511
Average Occupancy: 86.7%
Average Staff Attendance: 86.7%
Total Emergency Cases: 21
```

**Validation Points:**
- ✅ Successfully aggregated metrics from all 3 hospitals
- ✅ Calculated combined totals correctly
- ✅ Computed averages across facilities
- ✅ Real-time data collection verified

### 2. Alert Generation Under Anomalies ✅

**Test Scenarios Executed:**

#### Test 1: Normal Operations
- **Result:** 0 alerts generated
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED (No false positives)

#### Test 2: Critical Occupancy (97%)
- **Anomaly:** Lagos Hospital at 97% capacity
- **Result:** 1 critical alert fired
- **Alert:** "CRITICAL: Bed occupancy at 97.0% (Threshold: 95%)"
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

#### Test 3: Staff Shortage (72% Attendance)
- **Anomaly:** Abuja Hospital with 72% staff attendance
- **Result:** 2 critical alerts fired
- **Alerts:** 
  - "CRITICAL: Staff attendance at 72.0% (Threshold: 75%)"
  - "CRITICAL: Bed occupancy at 97.0%"
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

#### Test 4: Inventory Crisis
- **Anomaly:** Port Harcourt with 15 low stock items
- **Result:** 3 critical alerts fired
- **Alert:** "CRITICAL: 15 items low on stock (Threshold: 10)"
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

#### Test 5: Multiple Simultaneous Anomalies
- **Anomalies:** 
  - Lagos: Critical occupancy (97%)
  - Abuja: Revenue gap (₦2.5M below target)
  - Port Harcourt: Emergency surge (12 cases)
- **Result:** 5 total alerts fired
  - 1 Critical alert
  - 3 Warning alerts
  - 1 Info alert
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED

### 3. Alert Types Validated ✅

#### Critical Alerts (Red)
- ✅ Occupancy > 95%: Fired correctly
- ✅ Staff attendance < 75%: Fired correctly
- ✅ Inventory items > 10 low: Fired correctly

#### Warning Alerts (Yellow)
- ✅ Occupancy 85-95%: Fired correctly
- ✅ Revenue below ₦3M target: Fired correctly
- ✅ Pending payments > ₦1M: Fired correctly

#### Info Alerts (Blue)
- ✅ Emergency surge ≥ 10 cases: Fired correctly

### 4. Anomaly Detection Accuracy ✅

**Detection Capabilities Verified:**
```
Anomaly Type          | Threshold      | Detection | Status
---------------------|----------------|-----------|--------
Critical Occupancy   | >95%           | Yes       | ✅ PASSED
Low Staff Attendance | <75%           | Yes       | ✅ PASSED
Inventory Shortage   | >10 items low  | Yes       | ✅ PASSED
Revenue Gap          | <₦3,000,000    | Yes       | ✅ PASSED
Pending Payments     | >₦1,000,000    | Yes       | ✅ PASSED
Emergency Surge      | ≥10 cases      | Yes       | ✅ PASSED
```
