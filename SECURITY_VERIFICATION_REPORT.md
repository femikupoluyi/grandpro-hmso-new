**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Platform**: GrandPro HMSO Hospital Management System

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive security verification has been completed including security scans, audit log review, and disaster recovery simulation. All critical security measures are functioning as designed with a 95/100 security score.

## 1. Security Scan Results ✅

### Vulnerability Testing
| Test Category | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Status |
|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| SQL Injection | 4 | 4 | 0 | ✅ PROTECTED |
| XSS Attacks | 3 | 3 | 0 | ✅ PROTECTED |
| Security Headers | 5 | 5 | 0 | ✅ CONFIGURED |
| Rate Limiting | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ ACTIVE |
| Authentication | 1 | 0 | 1 | ⚠️ MINOR ISSUE |
| Session Security | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ SECURED |
| CORS Configuration | 1 | 1 | 0 | ✅ CONFIGURED |

**Overall Security Score: 95/100**

### SQL Injection Protection ✅
- Tested payloads blocked:
  - `' OR '1'='1`
  - `admin' --`
  - `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
  - `' UNION SELECT * FROM users --`
- **Result**: All SQL injection attempts blocked successfully

### XSS Protection ✅
- Tested payloads blocked/sanitized:
  - `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
  - `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
  - `javascript:alert('XSS')`
- **Result**: All XSS attempts neutralized

### Security Headers ✅
All required headers present:
- ✅ Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy: [comprehensive policy]
- ✅ Referrer-Policy: no-referrer

### Rate Limiting ✅
- **Configuration**: 100 requests per 15 minutes (general)
- **Login endpoint**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Test result**: Rate limiting triggered after threshold
- **Status**: Working as configured

### Minor Issues Found
1. **Profile endpoint access** (1 failure)
   - Issue: `/api/users/profile` returns 200 without auth
   - Severity: Low (no sensitive data exposed)
   - Recommendation: Add authentication check

2. **CORS in development mode**
   - Current: Allows all origins (*)
   - Recommendation: Restrict to specific domains in production

## 2. Audit Log Review ✅

### Audit Infrastructure
- **Database Table**: `audit_logs` created and operational
- **Fields Tracked**: 23 comprehensive fields including:
  - User identification (ID, email, role)
  - Network data (IP, user agent)
  - Action details (type, resource, result)
  - Security metadata (risk score, PHI access)
  - Compliance flags (HIPAA, GDPR)

### Audit Events Captured
- ✅ SECURITY_SETUP events logged
- ✅ LOGIN/LOGOUT attempts
- ✅ RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED events
- ✅ SECURITY_THREAT attempts
- ✅ Authorization failures

### Retention & Archival
- **Active retention**: 90 days in primary table
- **Archive retention**: 7 years (2555 days)
- **Automatic archival**: Configured
- **Fallback logging**: File-based backup if DB unavailable

### Risk Scoring
- **Implementation**: Automatic risk calculation (0-100)
- **High-risk threshold**: Score > 80 triggers alerts
- **Factors considered**:
  - Event type severity
  - User role privileges
  - PHI access
  - Failure status

## 3. Disaster Recovery Simulation ✅
