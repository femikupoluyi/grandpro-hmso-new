## 4. Security Testing Results

### Endpoints Protected
All sensitive endpoints properly require authentication:
- ✅ `/api/security/audit-logs` - 401 without auth
- ✅ `/api/security/permissions/*` - 401 without auth
- ✅ `/api/security/backups/*` - 401 without auth
- ✅ `/api/security/compliance/*` - 401 without auth
- ✅ `/api/security/encrypt` - 401 without auth

### Open Endpoints (By Design)
- ✅ `/api/security/consents` - Patient consent recording
- ✅ Public health information endpoints

## 5. Compliance Tracking

### Database Tables Created
```sql
audit_logs           -- All system actions
security_events      -- Security incidents
role_permissions     -- RBAC configuration
patient_consents     -- GDPR consent tracking
backup_history       -- Backup records
recovery_operations  -- Recovery attempts
encrypted_data       -- Encrypted field storage
retention_policies   -- Data retention rules
```

### Retention Policies Active
| Data Type | Retention Period | Method |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Medical Records | 7 years | Anonymize |
| Billing Records | 7 years | Archive |
| Audit Logs | 1 year | Archive |
| Security Events | 2 years | Archive |
| Session Data | 30 days | Hard Delete |
