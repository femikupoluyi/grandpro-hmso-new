## üìä Data Flow Architecture

### Owner Dashboard Data Flow:
1. User logs in with owner role
2. `RoleBasedRoute` validates access
3. `EnhancedOwnerDashboard` fetches data via `crm.service.js`
4. Mock data returned (ready for API integration)
5. UI renders with Nigerian localization (‚Ç¶ currency)
6. Real-time updates via polling/websockets (ready)

### Patient Portal Data Flow:
1. User logs in with patient role
2. `RoleBasedRoute` validates access
3. `EnhancedPatientPortal` fetches patient data
4. Appointment, reminder, and loyalty data loaded
5. User interactions trigger API calls
6. Points awarded for activities
7. Notifications sent via communication service

## üîí Security Implementation

### Role-Based Access:
- Owner routes: `/owner/*` - Only accessible by owners
- Patient routes: `/patient/*` - Only accessible by patients
- Admin routes preserved for system administrators
- Automatic role detection from JWT token
- Session validation on each route change

### Data Isolation:
- Owners see only their contract and payout data
- Patients see only their appointments and health records
- API calls include user ID from authenticated session
- Backend validates ownership before returning data
- No cross-role data leakage

## üé® UI/UX Features

### Nigerian Localization:
- Currency: NGN (‚Ç¶) formatting
- Phone numbers: +234 format
- Date format: DD/MM/YYYY
- Time: 12-hour format with AM/PM
- States and LGAs dropdown options

### Responsive Design:
- Mobile-first approach
- Tablet optimization
- Desktop full-feature view
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

### Material-UI Components:
- Consistent design language
- Theme customization
- Dark mode ready
- Loading states
- Error boundaries
- Success notifications

## üìà Mock Data Structure

### Owner Mock Data:
```javascript
{
  contracts: [
    {
      contractNumber: 'CONT-2024-001',
      hospitalName: 'Victoria Medical Centre',
      value: 15000000,
      revenueShare: 15,
      status: 'Active'
    }
  ],
  payouts: [
    {
      payoutId: 'PAY-2025-09-001',
      amount: 2500000,
      status: 'Completed',
      period: 'September 2025'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Patient Mock Data:
```javascript
{
  appointments: [
    {
      appointmentId: 'APT-2025-10-001',
      date: '2025-11-05',
      doctor: 'Dr. Sarah Johnson',
      status: 'confirmed'
    }
  ],
  loyaltyData: {
    points: 2500,
    tier: 'Silver',
    rewards: [...]
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Routes Configuration

### Updated Routes:
- `/owner` ‚Üí Enhanced Owner Dashboard
- `/owner/dashboard` ‚Üí Enhanced Owner Dashboard
