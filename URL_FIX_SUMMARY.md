# GrandPro HMSO - URL Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution
Successfully fixed and exposed all public URLs for the GrandPro HMSO platform. The application is now fully accessible via HTTPS endpoints.

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Service Exposure
- **Problem**: Public URLs were not functional
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed and configured Nginx as a reverse proxy
  - Exposed port 80 for frontend and port 8081 for backend API
  - Created proper proxy configurations with CORS headers

### 2. Process Management
- **Problem**: Services were not managed properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Installed PM2 process manager
  - Created ecosystem.config.js with proper environment variables
  - Configured auto-restart on failure
  - Enabled PM2 startup script for system boot

### 3. Database Connection
- **Problem**: Backend was crashing due to missing database credentials
- **Solution**: 
  - Added DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL to PM2 ecosystem config
  - Properly configured environment variables for production

### 4. Frontend API Connection
- **Problem**: Frontend was not connecting to the correct API endpoint
- **Solution**: 
  - Created .env.production with correct API URL
  - Rebuilt frontend with production configuration
  - Updated API URL to use the public HTTPS endpoint
