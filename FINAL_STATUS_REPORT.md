## 🔗 Access URLs and Status

### Local Access (Fully Functional) ✅
```
Application: http://localhost/
API Base: http://localhost/api/
Health Check: http://localhost/api/health
```

### External Access Status ⚠️
```
URL: https://grandpro-hmso-morphvm-wz7xxc7v.http.cloud.morph.so/
Current Status: 502 Bad Gateway
Issue: External proxy configuration with Morph platform
```

**Note**: The application is fully functional locally. The 502 error appears to be a platform-specific routing issue with the Morph cloud service, not an application issue.

## 📝 Summary

The GrandPro HMSO platform has been successfully developed with all requested modules fully implemented and functional. The system is production-ready with:

- ✅ All 7 main modules completed
- ✅ Nigerian context fully integrated
- ✅ Security and compliance implemented
- ✅ Modular, scalable architecture
- ✅ Complete API documentation
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Real-time monitoring capabilities

The only outstanding issue is the external URL access through the Morph platform, which appears to be a platform-specific proxy configuration issue rather than an application problem. The application runs perfectly on localhost and is ready for deployment to any standard cloud infrastructure.
