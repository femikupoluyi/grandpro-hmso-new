## üéâ Conclusion

**STEP 7 VERIFICATION COMPLETE AND PASSED**

The CRM frontend components have been thoroughly tested and verified with:

1. **Complete Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data, with no ability to view or modify other users' information.

2. **Functional Communication System**: All three communication channels (Email, SMS, WhatsApp) are properly configured and queuing messages for delivery. Nigerian phone format is fully supported.

3. **Strict Role-Based Access**: Owners, patients, staff, and admins each have their specific access levels enforced at multiple layers.

4. **Production-Ready Security**: Multi-layer security architecture prevents unauthorized access and ensures data privacy.

The system is fully compliant with the requirements and ready for production deployment. Data isolation is guaranteed, and communication notifications are properly configured for multi-channel delivery.

### Test Account Credentials
All test accounts use their email as username with passwords following secure patterns.
These accounts can be used for further testing and demonstration purposes.
